Top step -- Sara's pet spot.  T
Eel-fodder, stack-cats red do flee. T
Reg, no lone car won, now race no longer. T
Zeus was deified, saw Suez. T

Sir, I'm Iris!  T
Now do I repay a period won.  T
A rod, not a bar, a baton, Dora.  T
Now saw ye no mosses or foam, or aroma of roses. So money was won.  T
Amiced was I ere I saw Decima.  T

Senile felines. T
Max, I stay away at six A.M.  T

St. Simon sees no mists.  T
Draw, O coward! T
Top step's pup's pet spot.  T
Noel, did I not rub Burton? I did, Leon.  T
Puss, a legacy! Rat in a snug, unsanitary cage, lass, up! T

Noel saw I was Leon.  T
Now, sir, a war is won! T
Ha! Robed Selim smiles, Deborah!  T

No ham came, sir, now siege is won. Rise, MacMahon. T
Now Ned, I am a maiden nun; Ned, I am a maiden won. T
Ten animals I slam in a net.  T
Did I draw Della too tall, Edward? I did? T
Go hang a salami, I'm a lasagna hog.  T
Di, did I as I said I did?  T
Milestones? Oh, 'twas I saw those, not Selim. T
No, it's a bar of gold, a bad log for a bastion.  T
"Naomi, sex at noon taxes", I moan. T
Snug & raw was I ere I saw war & guns.  T
Doc, note, I dissent. A fast never prevents a fatness. I diet on cod. T

Red now on level -- no wonder.  T
Stop! Murder us not tonsured rumpots! T
Step on hose-pipes? Oh no, pets.  T
Stiff, o dairyman, in a myriad of fits. T

Name now one man. T
Dennis and Edna sinned. T
Nora, alert, saws goldenrod-adorned logs, wastrel Aaron!  T
Sums are not set as a test on Erasmus.  T
Deliver, Eva, him I have reviled. T
Damosel, a poem? A carol? Or a cameo pale? (So mad!)  T
Doom an evil deed, liven a mood.  T
God, a red nugget! A fat egg under a dog! T
Nurse's onset abates, noses run.  T
Roy, am I mayor?  T
Ron, Eton mistress asserts I'm no tenor.  T
I tip away a wapiti.  T
Adelberta was I ere I saw a trebled "A".  T
Sit on a potato pan, Otis.  T
Moorgate got nine men in to get a groom.  T
Repel evil as a live leper. T
Eva, can I stab bats in a cave? T
Did Hannah say as Hannah did? T
Goddesses so pay a possessed dog. T
Eva, Lave!  T
Ah, Satan sees Natasha. T
Do Good's deeds live on? No, Evil's deeds do, O God.  T
Madame, not one man is selfless; I name not one Madam.  T
Dora tended net, a rod. T
Golf, No, sir, prefer prison flog.  T
Nella risks all: "I will ask Sir Allen."  T
Now do I report "Sea Moth" to Maestro, period? Won. T

Ward nurses run "draw." T
Live dirt up a sidetrack carted is a putrid evil. T
Oh who was it I saw, oh who?  T
"Reviled did I live," said I, "as evil I did deliver."  T
Live was I ere I saw Evil.  T
Pull up, Eva, we're here, wave, pull up.  T
Revolt on Yale, Democrats edit "Noon-Tide Star." Come, delay not lover. T
Won race, so loth to lose car now.  T
No, it never propagates if I set a "gap" or prevention. T
Delia sailed, Eva waved, Elias ailed. T
I maim nine more hero-men in Miami. T
Rise, morning is red, no wonder-sign in Rome, Sir.  T
Emil asleep, Allen yodelled "Oy." Nella peels a lime. T
No. I save on final perusal, a sure plan if no evasion. T
Yreka Bakery. T
He lived as a devil, eh?  T
I saw thee, madame, eh? 'Twas I.  T
Dior Droid. T
Regard a mere mad rager.  T
I saw desserts; I'd no lemons, alas no melon. Distressed was I. T
A dog! A panic in a pagoda! T
Yawn a more Roman way.  T
Semite, be sure! Damn a man-made ruse betimes.  T
Pull up if I pull up. T
Able was I ere I saw Elba.  T
Eve saw diamond, erred, no maid was Eve.  T
"Slang is not suet, is it?" Euston signals. T
I roamed under it as a tired, nude Maori. T
Pa's a sap. T
No, miss, it is Simon.  T
Step on no pets!  T
Niagara, O roar again!  T
Lewd did I live; evil I did dwel. T
Too bad, I hid a boot.  T
"Rats gnash teeth," sang Star.  T
Lapp, Mac? No, sir, prison-camp pal.  T
Tide-net safe, soon, Allin. A manilla noose fastened it.  T
I moan, Naomi.  T
Too far away, no mere clay or royal ceremony, a war afoot.  T
Rats live on no evil star.  T
Deer frisk, sir, freed. T
I did roar again, Niagara! ... or did I?  T
No evil Shahs live on.  T
O gnats, tango! T
Stop, Syrian, I start at rats in airy spots.  T
"Not New York," Roy went on.  T
"Norah's moods," Naomi moans, "doom Sharon."  T
Eva, can I pose as Aesop in a cave? T
Trade ye no mere moneyed art. T
Was it a rat I saw? T
Help Max, Enid -- in example, "H."  T
So may Obadiah, even in Nineveh, aid a boy, Amos. T
See, slave, I demonstrate yet arts no medieval sees.  T
Egad, a base tone denotes a bad age.  T
Lew, Otto has a hot towel.  T
"Warden in a Cap," Mac's pup scamp, a canine draw.  T
Paget saw an inn in a waste gap.  T
A slut nixes sex in Tulsa.  T
Must sell at tallest sum. T
Naomi, did I moan?  T
Drab Red, no londer bard. T
Revenge my baby, meg? Never!  T
Stop, Syrian, I see bees in airy spots. T
Did I do, O God, did I as I said I'd do? Good, I did! T
Pusillanimity obsesses Boy Tim in "All Is Up."  T
Refasten Gipsy's pig-net safer. T
Pat and Edna tap. T
Adam, I'm Ada!  T
Ma is as selfless as I am.  T
Poor Dan is in a droop. T
Leon sees Noel. T
So may Obadiah aid a boy, Amos. T
Sis, Sargasso moss a grass is.  T
Now, Ned, I am a maiden won.  T
I moan, "Live on, O evil Naomi!"  T
Delia and Edna ailed. T
So remain a mere man. I am Eros.  T
No lemons, no melon.  T
Never odd or even.  T
Rise, sir lapdog! Revolt, lover! God, pal, rise, sir! T
Ah, Aristides opposed it, sir, aha! T
Ma is a nun, as I am. T
Madam, I'm Adam.  T
Star? Come, Donna Melba, I'm an amiable man -- no Democrats!  T
We'll let Dad tell Lew. T
No, it is opposition. T
No benison, no sin, Ebon. T
Ladle histolytic city lots I held, Al.  T
Harass selfless Sarah!  T
Ten? No bass orchestra tarts, eh? Cross a bonnet! T
Si, we'll let Dad tell Lewis. T
In airy Sahara's level, Sarah, a Syrian, I. T
Nor I, fool, ah no? We won halo -- of iron. T
We seven, Eve, sew. T
Peel's lager on red rum did murder no regal sleep.  T
"Go, droop aloof," sides reversed, is "fool a poor dog."  T
Sir, I soon saw Bob was no Osiris.  T
St. Eloi, venin saved a mad Eva's nine violets. T
Here so long? No loser, eh? T
Flee to me, remote elf. T
Six at party, no pony-trap, taxis.  T
Drab as a fool, as aloof as a bard. T
Red? Rum, eh? 'Twas I saw the murder. T
Pull a bat! I held a ladle, hit a ball up.  T
No, Hal, I led Delilah on.  T
Nomists reign at Tangier, St. Simon.  T
Nemo, we revere women.  T
Harass sensuousness, Sarah. T
Are we not, Rae, near to new era? T
Red root put up to order. T
"Sal is not in?" Ruth asks. "Ah, turn it on, Silas."  T
Retracting, I sign it, Carter.  T
A Toyota. T
He won a Toyota now, eh?  T
Gate-man sees name, garage-man sees name-tag. T
Live not on evil. T
Nella won't set a test now, Allen.  T
Ha! I rush to my lion oily moths, Uriah!  T
